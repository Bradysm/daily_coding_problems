# daily_coding_problems
repository containing my solutions to the daily coding problems sent out by Daily Coding Problem and Interview Cake. 
All of these solutions are in python :snake: to allow me (and you) to focus on the concepts of the problems instead of relying on meeting the syntactical verboseness required for languages like C and C++. 
Although I do enjoy coding in those languages, I prefer to interview in python as I use it A LOT for my AI class. 
Join me by solving a problem a day to help us all reach interviews with top tech companies! Are you ready? Let's get started!
