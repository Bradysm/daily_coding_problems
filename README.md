# daily_coding_problems
repository containing my solutions to the daily coding problems sent out by Daily Coding Problem and Interview Cake. 
All of these solutions are in python :snake: to allow me (and you) to focus on the concepts of the problems instead of relying on meeting the syntactical verboseness required for languages like C and C++. 
Although I do enjoy coding in those languages, I prefer to interview in python as I use it A LOT for my AI class. 
Join me by solving a problem a day to help us all reach interviews with top tech companies! Are you ready? Let's get started!

# What to expect
1. One coding problem to be completed and pushed to this repository everyday
    - the problem will directly come from Daily Coding Problem, HackerRanked, LeetCode, CodeFights, etc
2. Problem definition in comments at the top of the file
3. Detailed explination on various answers that I arrived at (I will try to include my best, as well as brute force solutions)
4. You to increase your coding skills and problem knowledge
