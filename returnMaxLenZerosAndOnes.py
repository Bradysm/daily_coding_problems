# given a binary array, return the max length of contiguous zeros and ones in the array
# capital one

# So Immediately when I saw this problem, I thought of the O(n) solution. I don't know if this
# is a testament to practice, but I realized that you want to almost converge in from the left
# and the right. Although I initially tried building from the left and incrementing the right
# I realized that we more so want to move in, instead of moving outwards. Then, when  you find
# the same numbers of ones and zeros between the two you return that number, else you 
# try to remove from the left if that's the correct removal, and if that's not the correct removal, 
# then greedily remove from the right. The key is to decrement the count from the number
# at that index, then continue moving forward.

# lastly, we keep looping as long as left is < right, the reason being is that there will never
# be and equal number of 1's and 0's if they're also the same index, so that's why it's
# not <=

# great! O(n) time and O(1) space!! CHEERS BRADY
