# given a list of numbers, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence

# the way that I like to think about these problems is to think of bellman equations
# With these equations, you choose your current step based on fact that all previous
# steps were optimal, thus choosing the optimal step at the current step will ensure
# that your current path is acting optimally. You see this alot in Value iteration
# for AI (fun reading and I highly recommend you look into those topics)

# anyways, to start of this problem, I will be using just a simple 
# bellman like equation that has you act opitmally based on the previous
# calculated values. So we will keep stepping down the array recurisvely,
# and then build the values back from teh bottom up. This is more a naive
# solution and it will have a runtime of around O(2^n). The reason why
# it is roughly O(2^n) is because not every index in the array will
# have a branching of 2. If the current index is not greater than
# the previous value, then there is only one branch that is taken.
# there is also a O(n^2) solution that can be created using a bottom
# up appraoch. I will detail this at the bottom of the script

# for this solution, the best way to think about it is that you either
# choose to include the value if it's greater than the prev, and then
# you also choose to not inlcude it to see if that could produce a more
# optimal solution. If that doesnt make sense to you, think of [1, 100, 5, 6, 7]
# If you always choose to only add the value if it's increasing and never choose
# to not add it, you will get 2 instead of 4 for this test case. So it's important
# to almost think of it like a powerset and to choose to include it or not.

# notice for this solution we do not carry the whole sequence. For the next
# solution I will show why carrying the whole sequence might be a good idea for
# certain problems. For this problem, adding the ith number only relies on
# the i-1 value, thus we just need to maintain the i-1 value and not
# the whole sequence.

# here is another interesting implementation
# for this problem, there is only n recursive calls
# but for each recursive call, there is a deep copy
# of all of the lists that were created up to that point
# in the worst case there are 2^n lists, and for each list
# of size k, there will be an O(k) deep copy thus making
# the time complexity O(n + 2^n*k). Although the time does
# not sound great at all, this would be a better algorithm
# for a problem that asked you to print out all the increasing
# subsequences within the given array.

# here is the O(n^2) solutuon. This will used cached sequence value to "build" the solution
# The whole premise of this problem is that we will build the solution up from subproblems

# lets think about the problem, so if we're at index i, the only subsequence that metters to index
# i is the sequence from 0 - (i-1). Thus, from every j in that range, if the value at nums[j] is < nums[i]
# then we know that this is a potential for a new greater subsequence. We then take the max of lis[j]+1 and lis[i]
# and place that into lis[i]. We add one to lis[j] because it's like were adding nums[i] to the sequence
# that gave us the value lis[j]
# this will run in O(n^2) time and will take O(n) extra space for the array
