# The way I was going to initially solve this problem was with the AC-3
# algorithm. Because each column represents a state of possible
# variables that can be assigned, and then as you place
# the values, you eliminate the values from the tail arc. I know that probably
# wasn't the easiest description to follow, but I hope that you can look into
# AC-3 and understand what I am talking about. The reason why this isn't
# going to work is because it finds ONE solution if there is one
# think of k-coloring, all we want is one coloring of the states. It doesn't
# matter how we get there, or if there is other colorings, we just care about 1
# since this problem cares about all queen representations on the board,
# we can't use AC-3

# okay back to the drawing board. Let's assign a queen to each column
# and determine queens by their column. Then we can "place" a queen on the board
# by going to their column (or index in the board array) and then changing that
# element to the row that we're placing the queen in. We then move onto the
# next column and try to place a queen at all the rows that are valid.
# we continue doing that until the column we're at is one past the end
# of the board, and when we get there, we know that board position
# is valid because for every k column, assuming the board is valid up to that
# point, we then place a valid position and move to the k+1 column. Thus
# it acts in an inductive way so we know the board is valid from valid decisions
# from each column. The runtime is O(n^n)
# this is not great at all haha

# we also know that all solutions are unique because each state is determined
# by the prior decision. Since we only make prior decisions once, we know
# the current state is unique, and thus all solutions are unique
